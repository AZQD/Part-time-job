##Scope and Consent

This Privacy Notice describes your privacy rights regarding our collection, use, disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information. It applies to any kalichimall site where this Privacy Notice appears in the footer, and to any kalichimall application, service, or tool (collectively "Services") where this Privacy Notice is referenced, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices.

By using our Services and/or registering for an account with us, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Notice and our User Agreement, and you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice and in our User Agreement. If you do not provide the information we require, we may not be able to provide all our Services to you.

###Personal Information

"Personal information" is information that can be associated with a specific person and could be used to identify that specific person whether from that data or from that data and other information that kalichimall has or is likely to have access to. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person.

###Changes to this Notice

We may amend this Privacy Notice at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are posted. We will notify you through the kalichimall Message Center and/or via email of any material changes to this Privacy Notice.

<a name="choice"></a>
##Choice

You have a choice about how we use your personal information to communicate with you, send you marketing information, and provide you with customized and relevant advertising.

###Communication Preferences

You can control how and when you want to receive notifications from kalichimall about your buying and selling activities and the methods by which we may contact you from the Communication Preference section within your My kalichimall. You can also control your member-to-member communications preferences setting and choose which newsletters and promotions you want to receive.

###Marketing

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. If you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can unsubscribe from the link in the email you received, change your Communication Preferences within My kalichimall or indicate your preferences within the direct communication from us.

###Advertising

We do not allow third parties to track or collect your personal information on our site for their own advertising purposes without your explicit consent. If you do not wish to participate in our ad-customization programs, you can opt-out by following the directions provided within the applicable advertisement, or directly at our Ad Choice program. The effect of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and internal online services operation purposes).

If you withdraw your consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Notice you may not have access to our all our Services and we might not be able to provide you all of the Services and customer support offered to our users and authorized under this Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.

##Access

We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate and up to date, and that you have the ability to access or correct it.

* You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to your account. Please update your personal information immediately if it changes or is inaccurate

* Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law

* We will honor any statutory right you might have to access, modify or erase your personal information. You can use the Contact Us to request access and find out whether any fees may apply, as permitted by law. Where you have a legal right to request access or request the correction of information, we can still withhold that access or decline to correct information in some cases in accordance with applicable law, but will give you reasons if we do so.
